Key Insights and Findings
1. Total Vehicles and Market Overview
The dataset includes 150,413 electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs.
The Average Electric Range is 67.83 miles, indicating the general efficiency of EVs.
BEVs form the majority of the market, with 116,745 vehicles, accounting for 77.6% of the total, whereas PHEVs make up 22.4% (33,668 vehicles).
These statistics highlight the increasing preference for fully electric vehicles over hybrid models.
2. Growth Trends: Total Vehicles by Model Year
A line/area chart illustrates the adoption trend from 2010 onwards.
The data reveals a steady growth in EV adoption, with a significant spike observed between 2018 and 2023, peaking at 37,098 vehicles in 2023.
This upward trajectory indicates rapid market expansion, driven by technological advancements and government incentives.
3. Geographic Distribution: Total Vehicles by State
A map visualization displays EV distribution across the United States.
Certain states exhibit significantly higher adoption rates, particularly states with strong EV policies and infrastructure.
For example, California dominates the market, contributing to a substantial proportion of the total EVs in the dataset.
4. Manufacturer Analysis: Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make
A bar chart highlights the top 10 manufacturers based on EV sales.
Tesla leads the market with 68,939 vehicles (52.7%), followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and BMW.
This dominance underscores Teslaâ€™s stronghold in the EV industry, with Nissan and Chevrolet as notable competitors.
5. Consumer Preferences: Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model
A tree map visualizes the most popular EV models.
Tesla Model Y (28,501 units) and Tesla Model 3 (27,708 units) are the most widely adopted.
Other notable models include Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt EV, and Tesla Model S, indicating a strong consumer preference for long-range, high-performance vehicles.
6. Regulatory Incentives: Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility
A donut chart illustrates vehicle eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.
41.81% (62,887 vehicles) are eligible, while 46.34% have unknown eligibility status, and 11.85% are not eligible.
This analysis helps in understanding the impact of government policies on EV adoption, encouraging more manufacturers to align their models with incentive criteria.
Conclusion and Business Implications
The EV market is growing exponentially, with Tesla maintaining a dominant position.
BEVs significantly outnumber PHEVs, signaling a shift towards fully electric models.
Government incentives and CAFV eligibility play a crucial role in EV adoption.
Geographic distribution insights can help policymakers and businesses strategize investments in EV infrastructure and manufacturing.
Companies can leverage this data to optimize production, target high-demand states, and improve vehicle range efficiency.
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for policymakers, automakers, and investors, offering a comprehensive view of the EV landscape and shaping future strategies for a sustainable, electric future.
