Sales Analysis Dashboard I worked on for Ferns N Petals. This dashboard provides key business insights, including:

Total Orders & Revenue: 1,000 orders, ₹35.2 lakh revenue
Customer Spending: ₹3,520 average per order
Peak Sales Periods: High demand in February (Valentine’s Day) & August (Raksha Bandhan)
Top Categories & Products: Colors, Soft Toys, and Sweets leading the charts
Geographic Trends: Strong performance in cities like Imphal and Haridwar
This analysis helps drive data-backed decisions for sales, marketing, and logistics optimization.

Would love to hear your thoughts on leveraging data analytics for business growth!
